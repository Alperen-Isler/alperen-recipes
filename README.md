# Alperen's recipes

This is my first project from **The Odin Project** curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to build a simple recipe website using only HTML.

## Project Description

The website consists of a main index page that links to several recipe pages.  
Each recipe page includes:
- a heading
- an image of the dish
- a list of ingredients
- step-by-step cooking instructions

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- semantic HTML structure
- using headings (`h1`–`h6`)
- creating links with anchor tags (`a`)
- adding images (`img`)
- working with ordered and unordered lists (`ol`, `ul`)
- organizing files and folders in a project
- linking multiple pages together
- basic CSS styling
- improving layout and readability with CSS

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
